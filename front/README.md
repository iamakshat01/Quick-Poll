# Local Setup

Clone the frontend and backend repositories, cd into them individually, and then follow the below mentioned steps for setting up backend and frontend seprately.

## 1. Frontend

1. Run `yarn install`.
2. Change backend port in config.js file if you change it in backend, by default the backend is setup to run on port 3000.

## 2. Backend

1. Run `npm install`.
2. We used MongoDB Atlas for hosted database, you can have a local database if you want but we recommend using Atlas. If you are using Atlas replace your database link in keys.js file of backend.

Run `npm start` in the Backend repo first and then `yarn start` in Frontend .
